# Airbnb Price Prediction Project
Authors: Jieun Hwang, Samir Hatem, Xiaorou Liang, Yejin Emily You

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to explore various models for predicting Airbnb listing prices per night in San
Francisco area. Many factors, such as the number of bedrooms, location, and host response rate were considered in
model formulation. We wanted to build a model that would allow hosts to appropriately price their listings. A
successful model would prevent the hosts from both overpricing and underpricing the listings, thus optimizing
the host’s profitability while maintaining affordability to the users. With the model, the users would be able to
understand what features of an Airbnb listing are most significant in determining the price.
